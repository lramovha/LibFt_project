# LibFt_project
wethinkcode libft project
On this project we create our own C library called libft which has the same function as libc Of C programming language.

ft_dup.c: Duplicates a string (similar to strdup).
ft_isalnum.c: Checks if a character is alphanumeric (a letter or a digit).
ft_isalpha.c: Checks if a character is alphabetic (a letter).
ft_isascii.c: Checks if a character is an ASCII character.
ft_isdigit.c: Checks if a character is a digit (0-9).
ft_isprint.c: Checks if a character is printable.
ft_isspace.c: Checks if a character is a whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
ft_itoa.c: Converts an integer to a string.
ft_lstadd.c: Adds a new element to the beginning of a linked list.
ft_lstdel.c: Deletes a linked list.
ft_lstdelone.c: Deletes a single element from a linked list.

ft_lstnew.c: Creates a new linked list element.
ft_memalloc.c: Allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
ft_memccpy.c: Copies memory from one location to another, stopping when a certain character is found.
ft_memchr.c: Searches for a character in a block of memory.
ft_memcmp.c: Compares two blocks of memory.
ft_memcpy.c: Copies memory from one location to another.
ft_memdel.c: Deallocates memory and sets the pointer to NULL.
ft_memmove.c: Moves memory from one location to another, handling overlaps.
ft_memset.c: Fills a block of memory with a specified value.
ft_nbrlen.c: Counts the number of digits in an integer.

ft_strdup.c: Duplicates a string.
ft_strequ.c: Checks if two strings are equal.
ft_striter.c: Applies a function to each character of a string.
ft_striteri.c: Applies a function to each character of a string with its index.
ft_strjoin.c: Concatenates two strings into a new string.
ft_strlcat.c: Concatenates two strings but ensures not to exceed a specified length.
ft_strlen.c: Returns the length of a string.
ft_strmap.c: Applies a function to each character of a string and creates a new string with the results.
ft_strmapi.c: Applies a function to each character of a string with its index, creating a new string with the results.
ft_strncat.c: Concatenates a specified number of characters from one string to another.
ft_strncmp.c: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
ft_strncpy.c: Copies a specified number of characters from one string to another.

ft_strrchr.c: Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.
ft_strsplit.c: Splits a string into an array of strings based on a delimiter.
ft_strstr.c: Locates the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
ft_strsub.c: Creates a new substring from a string.
ft_strtrim.c: Trims whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
ft_tolower.c: Converts a character to lowercase.
ft_toupper.c: Converts a character to uppercase.
ft_wordcount.c: Counts the number of words in a string.

Summary
This set of functions is typical of a C library that aims to provide additional utility functions beyond those provided by the standard C library. The functions cover a wide range of functionality, including string manipulation, memory management, character checking, and linked list operations.
